# SEMINAR HALL BOOKING SYSTEM

The major goal of the Seminar Hall Booking System is to keep track of all seminar hall
booking dates, history, and availability for all departments. The project is completely
restricted at the administrative level, and department members can only request access
from the administrator, who will guarantee it. The goal of the project is to create a
mobile app that will reduce manual labor in managing seminar room bookings. It keeps
track of all the facts about the booking's approval, rejection, or amendment. It keeps
track of all the details regarding the seminar room. Production of the report: It creates a
report on the status and history of seminar halls
